Here are some C programming project ideas tailored for beginners, intermediate, and advanced levels. These projects cover a range of domains, such as data structures, algorithms, games, and real-world applications.

Beginner-Level Projects
1. Number Guessing Game
The program generates a random number.
The user guesses the number, and the program provides hints ("Too high!" or "Too low!").
Add a score counter based on attempts.
2. Simple Calculator
Build a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Use switch-case for operation selection.
3. Temperature Converter
Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Allow the user to input a temperature and select the conversion type.
4. Student Grade Management
Input student names and marks.
Calculate and display grades based on marks.
Store and display the top scorer.
5. Prime Number Checker
Accept a number and determine whether it is a prime number or not.
Extend it to print all prime numbers in a given range.
Intermediate-Level Projects
1. Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Create a two-player game with a 3x3 board.
Use a 2D array to store the game state.
Detect winning conditions or a draw.
2. Banking System
Create a program to simulate basic banking operations:
Account creation.
Deposit, withdraw, and balance inquiry.
Use structures to store customer data.
3. Library Management System
Allow users to add, delete, and search for books.
Track issued and returned books.
Use files to save the library data persistently.
4. Matrix Operations
Perform matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transpose.
Use dynamic memory allocation for matrices.
5. File Handling: Word Counter
Read a text file and count the number of:
Words.
Lines.
Characters.
Display the counts to the user.
Advanced-Level Projects
1. Snake Game
Create the classic Snake game.
Use the terminal/console for graphics (with ASCII art).
Use arrow keys for movement and collision detection.
2. Hospital Management System
Allow for patient registration, doctor assignment, and billing.
Include features for storing patient histories and scheduling appointments.
Store data in files for persistence.
3. Quiz System
Develop a quiz program with:
Multiple-choice questions.
Timed responses.
Score tracking.
Use a file to store questions and answers.
4. Data Structure Visualizer
Create a console-based application to demonstrate:
Stack, queue, linked list, or binary tree operations.
Visual representation using text/ASCII art.
5. Compiler for a Tiny Language
Create a simple compiler/interpreter for a language with basic operations:
Variable declarations.
Arithmetic expressions.
Print statements.
Use lexing and parsing to interpret the language.
Real-World Applications
1. Chat Application
Create a console-based chat application using sockets.
Support client-server communication with multiple users.
2. Weather App
Use an API to fetch real-time weather data.
Display temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
3. Hotel Booking System
Manage room bookings, cancellations, and billing.
Include features for storing customer and room information.
4. Expense Tracker
Allow users to log expenses.
Generate reports based on categories (food, travel, etc.).
Provide monthly summaries.
5. Encryption and Decryption Tool
Implement Caesar cipher, VigenÃ¨re cipher, or RSA encryption.
Allow users to encrypt and decrypt messages.
Data Structure and Algorithm-Based Projects
1. Sorting Visualizer
Implement and display sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort).
Use text-based visualization (array printed as bars or values).
2. Pathfinding Visualizer
Implement pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra or A*.
Create a grid-based console application to demonstrate the shortest path.
3. Expression Evaluator
Convert infix expressions to postfix.
Evaluate the postfix expression using stacks.
4. Maze Solver
Generate or input a maze and use DFS or BFS to find the exit path.
Display the solution visually in the terminal.
5. Priority Queue
Build a priority queue using a heap data structure.
Demonstrate operations like insertion and extraction of the highest priority element.
Mini-Games in C
1. Hangman
Guess a word by entering letters.
Display the current state of the word and remaining attempts.
2. Rock, Paper, Scissors
Play a game against the computer.
Randomly generate the computer's choice and decide the winner.
3. Sudoku Solver
Input a Sudoku puzzle and solve it using backtracking.
4. 2048 Game
Create the 2048 puzzle game with a 4x4 grid.
Implement movement and merging of numbers.
5. Chess Game (Simplified)
Build a simple two-player chess game.
Allow basic moves and game termination conditions.
Tips for Starting a C Project
Plan First:

Outline the features and flow of your program.
Break it into smaller components (functions, modules).
Use Comments:

Add meaningful comments to improve readability.
Error Handling:

Anticipate invalid inputs or edge cases and handle them gracefully.
Debugging:

Test your code step-by-step using print statements or a debugger.
Documentation:

Include a README file explaining your project and how to use it.
