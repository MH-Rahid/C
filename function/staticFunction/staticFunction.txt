In C, a static function is a function whose scope is limited to the file in 
which it is declared. It is not visible or accessible from other files. 
This is achieved by using the static keyword in the function's declaration.

// Key Characteristics of Static Functions in C

File Scope:
A static function can only be accessed within the file where it is defined.
It is not exposed to other files during the linking phase.

Encapsulation:
Static functions help achieve data hiding by restricting access to 
implementation details within a specific file.

Separate Instances:
Even if two files define static functions with the same name, they do not 
conflict because each has its own separate scope.

Static Variables in Static Functions:
Static variables within a static function retain their value between function 
calls but are limited to the function's scope.

Syntax
static return_type function_name(parameters) {
    // Function body
}
